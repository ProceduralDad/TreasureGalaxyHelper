# TreasureGalaxyHelper
This is a tool for Speedrunners of the game Treasure Galaxy!

# To Download
Click the "redist" folder and download all contents- it's one exe, one folder named "Images", and one Image inside that folder. Keep these files together and doubleclick the .exe to run the program. This is software for Windows and you will need to be running .NET Framework. You can get it from ninite.com if you lack it.

# To Contribute
Jump in and do whatever you want. The code is here mainly for transparency, in case anyone wants to compile it themselves, and I do not expect to work on it further.

# TO DO
In the very unlikely case someone wishes to iterate on this.

The code contains an unfinished OCR feature. Expand the Form1 in Designer mode to see controls that are currently hidden. The idea is that this could be running, reading the screen, and OCR'ing the unfinished level 5 satellite codes. I got this working but tesseract was not giving acurrate results. In addition the form becomes unresponsive when "BeginOCR" was clicked and doesn't seem to autoupdate when DOSBOX is running. I am pretty much done with it and do not plan to continue development on this.
